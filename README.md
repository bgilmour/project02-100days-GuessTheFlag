# Project 2 (GuessTheFlag)

This is my solution to the GuessTheFlag project (project 2) in the [100 Days Of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/) tutorial created by
Paul Hudson ([@twostraws](https://github.com/twostraws)). It includes my additions to the step-by-step solution created when following the tutorial
to provide solutions for the three additional challenges.

It has also been updated with a challenge presented in project 3 and three further challenges presented in project 6.

Further changes from project 15 to add accessibility hints.
